# Object Following Bot

An advanced object-following robot that uses state-of-the-art computer vision techniques for object detection and tracking. This project integrates multiple technologies to enable a bot to detect, track, and follow objects in real-time.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection.
- **Object Tracking**: Implements advanced algorithms for accurate and efficient object tracking.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes video frames in real-time to provide immediate feedback and movement.
- **Hardware Integration**: Communicates with hardware components (motors, sensors) via PySerial.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV (for image processing and manipulation)
- **Object Detection**: YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib (for visualizing object tracking and analysis)
- **Numerical Computation**: NumPy (for efficient numerical operations)
- **Hardware Communication**: PySerial (for serial communication with hardware)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-following-bot.git
   cd object-following-bot
